Simulations of spin-1 magnetic systems

In this project c/c++ and Open MP were use in order to simulate the physics of low dimensional magnetic systems. Further studies and conclusions upon these results are presented in the book: Magnetic properties of spinor boson gases in optical lattices: a Gutzwiller variational approach.
